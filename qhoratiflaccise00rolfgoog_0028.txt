xxii-nv, and i.-xxi. The first collection was composed in
various meires, the last two in hexameters.

Of the work of Lucilius only a comparatively small uum-
beros fragments survive, and the longest continuans passage
consists of but fourteen lines. Newertheless, from these
and from the scattered notices of the grammariaus, some

Book xxvi, which was the first in order of publication,
contained a justification of Satire, an account of the Nu-

of the nature and the object of Satire, and literary criticism
seems to have been a feature of this, as well as of some of
the other books. In Book ii. a suit is described, which was
brought by Τ. Albucius against Q. Mucius Scaevola, ou
account of the latter's extortions in Asia Book iii. con·
taiued an account of a jouruey from Borne to the Straits
of Messana, on which Horace modelled the fifth Seruio ol
his first book Book iv. included a discourse on gluttony,
followed by Persius in his third satire. Book ix. dealt with
literary criticism and with grammatical questions, in par-
ticular with orthography. Book x. inspired Persius to
write Satine, and Book xiii. seems to have had the same
theme as Horace's Sum. ii. 4. Of Book xvi. Porphyrio¹

are rude and unpolished, not only when judged by classical
standards, but also as compared with the earlier writings of
Terence. Munro² regards Horace’s estimate ol him as far
