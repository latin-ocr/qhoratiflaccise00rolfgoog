Quinque dies tibi pollicitus me rure futurum,
Sextilem totum mendax desideror. Atqui
Si me vivere vis sanum recteque valentem,
Quam mihi das aegro, debis aegrotare timenti,
Maecenas, veniam, dum licus prima calorque
Dissignatorem decorat lictoribus atris,
Dum pueris omnis pater et matercula pallet,
Officiosaque sedulitas et opella lorensis
Adducit febris et testamenta resignat.
Quod si bruma nives Albanis inlinet agris,
Ad mare descendet vates tuus et sibi parcet
contractusque leget; te, dulcis amice, reviset
Cum Zephyris, si concedes, et hirundine prima
