to hare been composed iu various metres. No prose frag-
ments can with certainty be attributed to the elder Ennius.

Το what extent Ennius was iudebtcd to Greek originale
isa matter of dispute. If we take into account the well-
known statement ol Quintilian¹ aud the case of Varro,2 it
seems probable that the form was original with Ennius,
and that it was adapted from the dramatic saturo, although
in his subjectmatter he undoubtedly followed Greek sources,
It is perhaps noteworthy that the early writers of satire, as
well as those to whom such works are attributed, were also
dramatic poets.

The satires of Ennius also resembled those of Horace, in
that he recorded his personal experieuces and feelings,
aud made free use of the Aesopiau fablcs.³

Saturae are attributed by Diomedes⁴ and by Porphyrio⁵
to the nephew of Ennius the tragic poet and painter,
M. Pacuvius (220-13213e.) of Brundisium, but it is pos-
sible that his secturae, like those of Naemus, were dramatic.⁶

19. The Menippean satires of M. Terentius varro (116-
28 ac.) of Reate belong to the school ol Eumne, so far as
their form is concerued. In a medley of prosc andve1·se,the
latter representing many different matres, ho describes aud
comments on familiar events of everyday life. The collec- ·
tion consisted of one hundred and fifty books, and its nature
is indicated by some of the titles of the various topics which
have come down to us : Cooe curtem· Nescis quid uesper serus
vebat, oras credo, bodie ullu'l,· Btmorcus; alar-coporis, etc.

The titles, as well as the statement of Cicero in Acud.
Post. ii. 8, lead to the inference that, while Varro modelled
his work in general on the Σπουδογέλοιον of Menippus of
