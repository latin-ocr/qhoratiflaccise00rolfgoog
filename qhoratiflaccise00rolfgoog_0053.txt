nunciatiom Right here is where the pupil is apt to err.
He fails to make the syllable ‘closed' ie. he does not joiu
the first of the two or more consonants to the preceding
vowel, but joins all of the consonants with the following
vowel. He thus leaves the preceding syllable ‘open'
Hence, if the vowel itself is short, the syllable by this in·
correct pronunciation is nrade short, where it ought to be
made long. Thus the student is apt to say teme-stottbus
where he ought to say tempesto-tibus, ic. he joins both the
saud the t with the following vowel, where he ought to
y'oin the s with the preceding vowel (thus making a ‘closed’
syllable), and only the t with the following vowel.l

Errors of the kind referred to are so liable to occur that
it seems best to classify them by groups : -

a. The communest group consists of those words which
contain a short vowel followed by doubled consonants (pp,
cc, tt, etc.),—-words of the type of appordbat, acecpiebam,
attigerunt, pes-serunt, ter-rd-mm, art-norum, addiderat, flam
morum, excel-lentio, apperimus, etc. ln Latin, both of the
doubled consonante were pronounced, one being combined
with the previous vowel (thus closing the syllable and
making it long), one with the following vowel. But in
English we practieally never have doubled consonante.
We write thern and print them, but we do aot pronouoce
them. Thus, we write and print leit-ty, ser-ry, etc, but we
do not pronounce two t’s or two r’s in these words any
more thau in pity, which we write with one t, or in very,

consonants is regularly joined in pronunciation with the preceding
vowel, thus elosinp the preceding syllable. This is the real significance
ol the common rule that a syllable is long when a short vowel is lol-
lowed by two consonante. lt is because one of the consonante isjoined
to the preceding vowel, thus closing the syllable.

¹‘lhls doctrine, to be sure, contradicts the rulcs given in grammars for
divisiones words into syllables, but those rules apply only to writlng,
not actual utterance. See Bennett, Appendr't to Latin Grammcr, 535.
