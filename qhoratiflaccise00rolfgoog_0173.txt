ΟΝ TRUE INDEPENDENCE.

1. Occasion of the Epistle : In this letter addressed ιο Scaeva, who
is otherwise unknown, Horace shows that one may obserre proper
deference towards a patron without sacrificing one’s seli-respect.
lie gives sorno humorous directions lor gaiuing the favor oi great
rnen.

2. outline:

i. Horace modestiy asks ιο ιο allowed ιο express his rlews on
the subject, l-t ;
2. Il one is really indifferent to riches and honora, one must act
accordingly, 6-i2; ·
3. But such an attitude ie not essential ιο a proper independencs:
c) This is shown by the conduct oi Aristippus. The excessivo
asceticism oi Diogenes was due to tire fact that he did

3. Time: Τιο exact date cannot ιο determined. Not eleccione.

Quamvis, Scaeva, satis per ιο tibi consulis et scis

Quo tandem pacto deceat maioribus uti,

Disce, docendus adhuc quae censet amiculus, ut si

Caecus iter monstrare velit3 tamen adspice, si qnid

Et nos, quod cures proprium iecisse, loquamur. ο
Si ιο grata quies et primam somnus in horam

Delectat, si ιο pulvis strepitusque rotarum,

Si laedit caupona, Ferentinum ire iubebo.
