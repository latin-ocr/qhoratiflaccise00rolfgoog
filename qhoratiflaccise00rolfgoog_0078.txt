A JOURNEY TO BRUNDISIUM.

1. occasion of the Satira: In the year 40 ae. Antony and Octa·
vian became reconciled, and struck a treaty at Brundisium. Two years
later Octavian wasdeieated iu a naval engagement by Sextus Pompeius,
and despatched Maecenas to Athens, ιο ask Antony ior help. In the
spring ci at the latter appeared cii Brundisium with a ileet of three
hundred ships, and Octavian, who had meanwhile repented of his call
ior aid, sent Maecenas, with Cocceius and Fonteius Capito, to come tc
terme with his rival. lt is the journey oi Maecenas to Brundisium on
this occasion which the satire describes. Maecenas was evidently in
nc haste, since the trip, which might have been made in irem six to
nine days, occupied fifteen.

Antony was not allowed ιο land at Brundisium, and a treaty was
finally made, with some difficulty, at Tarentum.

Lucilius had described a Journey irom Rome to Capua and thence
along the coast to the Straits oi Messana. It is not impossible that
Horace placed this satire immediately aiter his criticism oi Lucilius
with the purpose oi challenging comparison. An examination oi the
few extant fragments oi the narrative oi Lucilius fully supports Hor-
ace’s claim oi superiority in versification and general finish.

2. The itinerary: The distances are lor the most part known
from inscriptions. Uncertainty is caused in three cases by doubt as ιο
the exact location oi the villa near Trivicum and the oppidulum qaod
versa dicere non est. Desy'ardins assumes that the travellers did not
spend the night at Capua or at Beneventum, while Gibbon does not
allow a night at Terracina
