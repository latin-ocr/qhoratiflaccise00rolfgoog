Livy. Books l. XXI.. and XXII.

- With Introduction and Notes by Professor J. ts. Westcott Prinoeton
University. samo, eloth, 42⁶ peges. Priee, 31³5.

N attempt has been made iu this volume to present in simple
and convenient form the assistance needed by young stu·
deuts making their first acquaintance with Livy.

The editor's experieuce iu the class-room has led him to anno·
tate the text copiously. On the other hand, that fulness of illus·
tration which apparently aims to supersede the function of the
›teacher has been carefully avoided.

Professor James ll. Dillard, Tutane University, Νιω Orkas, La.:1
should lite to say that Westcott’s Livy is the most satisfactory text-book
that l know of. Other worlts may put on a greater show of learning;
but when one comesto every-day class-room use, th‘e editing of this ¹text

is found to be exceptionally satisfactory.

Professor charles Ε. Bennett, Cornell Unimstty, ithaca, Ν. Υ..· tt seems
to me an excellent bools. The notes are exceedingly fresh aud scholarly;
they call attention to the right things in the right way. This edition is
superior to any similar edition with which l am acquainted.
