common, ie. it may be either long or short in verse at the
option of the poet. The explanation of this peculiarity is
as follows:—

In a word like patrem, for example, it was recognized
as legitimate ιο pronounce in two ways: either to combine
the tr with the following vowel (pueram), thus leaving the
preceding syllable ‘open' and short, or to join the t with ν

Α the preceding vowel (pot-rem), thus elosing the preceding
syllable and making it long. Hence, in the caseos common
syllables, the quantity in each individual instance depends
upon the mode of pronunciation, rte. the mode in which we ‚
divide the syllable. In reading Latin poetry, therefore, it
will be necessary lor the pupil to observe how the poet
treats each common syllable, and to pronouuce accordingly.

The rule for Elision, as stated in our Latin grammars, is
in substance as follows: “A final vowel, a final diphthong‚
orm with a preceding vowel,¹ is regularly elidad before a
word beginning with a vowel or h.''

The exact nature of Elision, as observed by the aucients
in reading Latin verse, is still very uncertain. The Romans
may have slurred the words together in some way, or they
may have omitted the elided part entirely.

with the preceding vowel, and so elosing the syllable.

2. Make the word-accent light3 subordinate it carefully
