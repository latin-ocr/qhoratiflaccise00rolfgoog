Varius ; through their influence he was admitted (39 nc.)
to the intimacy and friendship oi Maecenas, the confidential
adviser of Octavian, and a generous patron of literature.
About six years later (probably 33 aa), he received from
Maecenas the Sabine Farm, situated some thirty miles to
the northeast of Rome, in the valley of the Digentia, a
small stream flowing into the Anio. This estate was not
merely adequate lor his support, enabling him to devote
his entire energy to study and poetry, bnt was an unfailiug
source of happiness as well, Horace never wearies oi singiug
its praises.

5. Horace’s Other Prieudships. — Horaee's friendship with
Maecenas, together with his own admirable social qualities
and poetic gifts, wou him an easy entrance into the best
Roman societyss His Odes bear eloquent testimony to his
friendship with nearly all the eminent Romans of his time.
Among these were: Agrippa, Octavian's trusted general,
aud later his son-in-law3 Messalla, the friend of Horace’s
Athenian student days, and later oue of the iorenrost ora·

lettere, oratory, and arms. The poets Virgil aud Varius
have already been mentioned. Other literary friends were:
Quintilius Varus, Valgius, Plotius, Aristius Fuscus and

Tibullus.

6. Relations with Augustus-With the Emperor, Hor-
ace’s relations were intimate and eordial. Though he had
fought with conviction under Brutus and Cassius at Phi-
lippi, yet he possessed too much sense and patriotism to be
capable of ignoring the splendid promises of stability and
good government held out by the new regime inaugurated
by Augustus. In sincere aud loyal devotion to his sover-
eign, he not merely accepted the new order, but lent the
best efforts of his verse to glorifying and strengthening it.
