for the objects of his comment, such as Nouius, the parve

plays upon words, and his coinage of new terms, his irony
and sarcasm, ond in general a quizzical way of looking at
things and an eye for the comical side oflife.

consists of centos from Horace. The satirist Amarcius, of .
the eleventh century, made extensive use of Horace. Al-
