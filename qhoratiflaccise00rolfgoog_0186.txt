Cum tot sustineas et tenta negotia solus.
⁴ Res Italas armis tut teris, moribus ornes,
. Legibus emendes, in publica commoda peccem,
Si longo sermone morer tua tempora, Caesar.
Romulus et Liber peter et cum Castore Pollux, t
Post ingentia facta deorum rn templa recepti,
Dum terras hominumque &olunt genus, aspera bella
Componunt, agros adsignant, ορρίᾶμπο condunt,
Ploravere suis non respondere favorem
Speratum meritis Dir'ani pur contudit hydram ιο
Notaque fatali portenta labore subegit,‘'
Comperit invidiam supremo fine domari. 1,,
Urit enirn fulgore suo, qui praegravat artis
Infra se posites5 exstinctus amabitur idem.
Praesenti tibi maturos largimur* honores,
