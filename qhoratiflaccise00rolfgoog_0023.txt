15. The derivatico of the adjective eatur has not been
satisfactorily explained. It is the only adjective in -ur in
the Latin language which belongs to the odeclension, 11101
which was observed and commented on by the native gram·
marians.¹ Its early occurrence in the sense of ‘full' makes
it improbable that it is a borrowed word, from the Greek
σάτυροι. 11 11 used with that meaning, for instance, by
Plautus, >Mera 927, ribi satur som, nullo crepitant: quondo
esurio, tum crepont; cf Horace, Ser-in. i. 1. 119, cedet uti
convivo satur. In a metaphorical sense, as applied to the
mind, the word is early and frequent, occurring, for example,
in Plaut. Poeo. prol. 8, qui 11011 edistis, satarifite sabulis. In
postclassical Latin the adjective gradually went 0111 of
use, doubtless on account of its isolated grammatical form.
Sotiates (It. aazia) and 10111101 (It. estollo,· Fr. sottl) seem to

have taken its place.
