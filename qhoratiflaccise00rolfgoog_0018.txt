Χ HORACE'S WORKS.

In the life of Horace attributed to Suetonius, we leam

He remained true to the Muse till his death, November
27, 8 mc, a few days before the completion of his fifty-

amusing incidents of personal experience and good-natured
raillery at the defects of the prevailing philosophical systems,
of which he was always an earnest and intelligent student.
Besides this we have several picces dealing directly with
