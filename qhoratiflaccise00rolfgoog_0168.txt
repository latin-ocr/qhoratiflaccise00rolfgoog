Vibo, and Regium.

Horace represents himself as false to his ideals oi lite (cs. l. 1. 18,
nanc io Aristippi furtim proeoepta relabor), astate oi mind doubtless
due to his ill-health (es. i. 8. 3-12), although we are hardly justified in

Quae sit hiems Veliae, quod caelum, Vala, Salerni,
Quorum hominum regio et qualis viar-nam mihi Baias .
Musa supervacuas Antonius, et tamen illis
Me iacit invisum, gelida cum perluor unda
Per medium frigus. Sane murteta relinqui
Dictaque cessantem nervis elidere morbum
Sulpura contemni vicus gemit, invidus aegris,

Qui caput et stomachum supponere fontibus audent
Clusinis, Gabiosque petunt et frigida rura

Mutandus locus esi et deversoria nota 10
Praeteragendus equus. ‘Quo tendis? Non mihi Cuma

f Est iter aut Baias’ laeva stomaehosus habena
