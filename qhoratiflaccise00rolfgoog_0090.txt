were deposited. This region was the resort oi those who practised
magio rites, sium such ceremonies were associated with the under-
world and with the dead.

At some time which is not exactly known, Maecenas purchased the
place, and had it filled in and laid out with gardens. Here also stood
his palace with a high tower (cs. Odea iii. 29. 10).

The tombs and columbaria seem to have been leit undisturbed (cs.
line 36), and on this account, oron account oi the old associatione oi the

Mille pedes in fronte, trecentos cippus in agrum
Hic dabat, heredes monumentum ne sequeretur.
Nunc licet Esquiliis habitare salubribus atque
Aggere in aprico spatiari, qua modo tristes 15
Albis informem spectabant ossibus agrum3
Cum mihi non tantum furesque feraeque suetae
Hunc vexare locum curae sunt atque labori,
