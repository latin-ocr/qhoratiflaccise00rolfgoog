IN this bools the essential facts of Latin Grammar are pre·

sented within the smallest compasa consistent with high
scholarly standards. lt covers not only the work of the pre·
paratory school, but also that of the required courses in college
and university. By omitting rare forms and syntectical usages
found only in ante-classical and post-classical Latin, and by
relegating to an Appendix theoretioel and historical questions,
it has been found possible to treat the subject with entire ade·
quacy in the compass of 250 peges exclusive of lndexes. ln
the German schools, books of this scope fully meet the exacting
demands of the entire gymnasial course, and those who have
tried Bennett's Grammnr find that they are materially helped by
being relieved of the mass of useless and irrelevant matter which
forms the bulk of the older grammars. All Latin texts for read·
ing in secundary schools, recently issued, contain references in
the notes to Bennett’s latin Grammar.

Professor william Δ. Houghton, Boudaia college, Brennum, Maiae.-
The Grammar proper is admirably adopted to its purpose in its clearness
of arrangement and classifioation‚ and in its simplicity and precision of
statement, giving definitely just what the pupil must know, and not crowd·
ing the page with a mass of matter that too offen disheartens the young
student instead of helping him. 1 trust it will oome into general use, for
1 think for the reasons just given, and &oense of its moderate composa
and attractive appearance. students are likely to get more practical gram·
matical knowledge out of it than they generally do from the larger
grammata

John 1². Foth, Oberlr'n Academy, Olenia, Olio: Bennett's Latin Grammar
was adopted aa a text-book in Oberlin Academy in 1⁸97· 1t is proving
itself a very satisfactory text-book and increasingly popular. Tne toachers
of Latin in Oberlin Academy are thoroughly salished with the book and
lind it exceedingly helpful in their work.

une cnue,Feb.29‚1ooo The book is a marvel ol condensed. yet clear
utttl forcible. statement. The ground covered in the treatment of forms
and syntax is adequare for ordinary school work and fot the use of Μ’
rnen and sophomores in college.
