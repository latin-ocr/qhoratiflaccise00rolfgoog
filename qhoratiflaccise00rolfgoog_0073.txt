THE OLD AND Tus NEW shulsu.

1. outlinet

1. The earlier satire attached all men who were vulnerabis, and
held them up to public ridicule. lt was therefore gener·
ally ieared and detested:

a) Its prototypo was the Old Comedy oi the Greeks, ¹-5;

b) Its greatest Roman representative was Lucilius, who had
two serious iaults, 6-7 :

1) lie was too diffuse, 8-12;
2) lie was careless in composition, 12-13;

c) Horace proposes to improre on Lucilius in two ways:

l) By not writing voluminously and carelessly, 13-21 ς
2) By not forcing his works on a public to which they
might be distssteiul, ‘er-38.

2. Horace's conception oi satire, and his reasons ior cboosing that
field oi writing:

a) lle does not claim the title oi poet. He merely describes
the events oi ereryday iiie in verse, 38-62;

b) It is unreasonable to leur him, ior no blameless man is et·
taclred. Moreover, he writes merely ior the entertainment
and instruction oi a small circle oi friends, oti&

c) He does not take pleasure in hurting people’s feelings. He
finds amusement in the weaknesses und eceentricities oi
others, but without malice, 78-103;

d) lt is natural ior him to observe the conduct oi others. He
was trained to do so in his youth by his iether, asa means
oi seli-improvement, 103-126;

e) He endearors not merely to note the good and the bed quali-
ties oi others, but to proiit by his observation. His readers
may draw their own moral, 12o137 ;

s) To jot down his thoughts is doubtless a wealrness, but lt
should be forgiven. Ii not, he will call all his follow-poete
to his aid aud compel his criticsto join the erait, 131-143.

2. Time: The exact date is uncertain ; not aiter 35 mc.
