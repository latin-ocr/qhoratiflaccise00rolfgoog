begins in due form with a dedication to Maecenas, and the
arrangement of the separate satiras is a natural, though not
a chronological one, and may well he the one chosen by
Horace himself. In most cases the poet himself appears as
the speaker,¹ although considerable dialogne is introduced.

That the reception given to this work was not altogether
favorable, is shown by Horace's own words in the intro
ductory satire of the second Book of Semnones, which seems
to have been published in 30 nc. This book has no formal
dedication aud no epilogue, and is cast for the most part in
dialogne form. Horace himself plays usually a very sub

r ordinate part, and in one satire he does not appear at all.²

The first and sixth satires are of a persona] nature; the
former· is a dialogne between Horace and Trebatius, the
latter practically a monologue, although it is assirnilated to
the other works of the collection by the introduction of
Cervius and his fahle of the town aud the country mouse.

2⁵. The Epistulae belong to the general class of Saturae?
but they are distinguished from the Sermones not only by
their form, but by their contents as well, Hexarueter verse
is not well suited to dialogne, and Horace evidently pre·
ferred to adopt a new literary form, the poetic epistle, for
his umorue, rather than to abendon the conventione] metre.

The first book of Epistulae seems to have been issued in
20 nc. During the teu years which had elapsed since his
last venture in the field of satire, Horace had published
three books of Odes, and had reached the age of forty-five.
The practical philosophy of life now seems to him the thing
most worthy of his attention, and it is to the teaching of

this that his first hook of Epistles is iu the rnaiu devoted.
