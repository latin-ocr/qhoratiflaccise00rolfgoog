the word has the sense of the Greek σάτυροι and refers to
the dress of the actors, who he believes were clad in goat

Roman comedy, it seems to have survived as a literary
form. The same thing was true of the ner-sus Fescennini,
which appear in the classical period in the epithalamicis

and the like. In its earliest form it seems to have beena
medley of prose and of verse in various metres, in which a
variety of subjects were briefly treated. The earliest repre·
sentative oi this form of composition is said to have been

the aalma of Naevius, to which Festus refers, was dramatic.

saturae is Quintus Ennius (239-16912a.) of Rudiae in Cala·
bria,² ‘the father of Roman poetry,' lrom whose work a
