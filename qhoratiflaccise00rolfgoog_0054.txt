which we write with one r. Now, in pronouucing Latin
the pupil is very apt to pronounce the doubled consonante
of that language as single cousouants, just as be does in
English. Thus he naturally pronouuces the words above
given, not apparebat, etc, but dperdbat, dciyriebom, dtipe·
root, pre-serunt, ter-cram, ecorum, ediderat, fldmdrum, eece-
lentr'a, siper-imus. In other words, the pupil pronounces only
one consonant, where he ought to pronounce two, and that
one consonant he joius with the following vowel. He thus
leaves tbe preceding syllable ‘open,' ie. he makes it short
when it ought to be long.

The effecte of this pronunciation are disastrous in read·
ing Latin poetry, for these doubled consonante occur on an
average iu every other line of Latiu poetry.

b. The second group consists of words in which a short
vowel is followed by sp, sc, st; also by sd, scr, str. In
English, when the vowel following these combinations is
accented, we usually combine the consonante with the fol-
lowing vowel. Thus we say ascribe, estodrrdiap, etc. Now,
the Latin pupil is almost certain to do the same thing in
pronouucing Latin, unless he ison his guard, te. he is likely
to say emersus, fethrum, tempestivus, coruscabat, mtscderat,
moptstrrirum, ascripsit, etc. What he ought to do is to J'oin
thes with the preceding vowel (thus making the syllable
closed, and long), pronouucing aspersos, istorum, tempos
ttous, coruscabat, mis-suerat, magistrorum, assmpsit, etc. By
joining all the consonants to the following vowel he leaves
the preceding syllable open. Hence, when the preceding
vowel is short, the syllable also becomes short. This
destroys the metre of the line.

c. The third group consists of words containing a short
vowel followed by r and some consonant. Iu our common
English utterance we are ver‘y apt to neglect the r. This
tendency is all but universal in N ew England, and is widely
