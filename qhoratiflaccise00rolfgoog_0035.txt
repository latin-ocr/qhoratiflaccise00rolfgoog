though Horace’s lame in the Middle Ages was much less
than that of Virgil, he too was regarded as a magician, and
his grave was held in honor. These were, however, purely
local manifestatione aud were confiued to Palestrina and
Venusia.

ence iu modern times is out of the question. He has been
probably the most widely read aud admired of all the Roman
poete, and has appealed to men of the most widely different
testes.

Together with Juvenal, his induence upon French satire,
which culminated in Boileau, was very great, while the
English satirists, Dryden, Butler, Pope, Swift, Prior, Gay,
Congreve, and others, show many evidences of the influente
of Horace or duvenal, or oi both.
