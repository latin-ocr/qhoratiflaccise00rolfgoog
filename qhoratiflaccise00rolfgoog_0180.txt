EPISTULARUM

XIX.
THE Polis ΟΝ ms comcs,

1. occasiones the Epistle: The Oclcs (Books 1.-111.) haderidently ι
met with uniavorable criticism outsidc oi the small circle oi the poet's
friends. ile points out to Maecenas the injustice of the charges which
trave been made against him, and expresses contempt ior his detrec
cors

2. outline:

l. lt is one thing to follow a model, quite another to etoop to
slavish and ignorant imitation: ’
o) Because Homer, Cratinus, and Ennius have written in
praise oi wine, obscure poete hope to become great by
hard drinking, l-ll ; ·
b) Just as ii the virtue of aceto depended on his stern iace
and careless drem, or a poet’s success on his complexion,
2. Horace is a pioneer and no imitator. ile followed Greek
originale, but not with servile imitation. Alcaeus and
Sappho also had their models, lii-34,
3. The real reason ior his unpopnlarity is that he has not tried
to plesse the messes, or deigned to court the lavor oi «
the critias. li he is therefore accused oi arrogance, he
prefers not to argue the matter, ilo-49.

3. Time: From its position in the collection the letter would seem
to belong ιο the year 20 nc.

Prisco si credis, Maecenas docte, Cratino,

Nulla placere din nec vivere carmina possunt,
. Quae scribuntur aquae potoribus. Ut male sanos

Adscripsit Liber Satyris Faunisque poetas,
Vina fere dulces oluerunt mane Camenae.
Laudibus arguitur vini vinosus Homerus3
Ennius ipsc pater numquam nisi potus ad arma
Prosiluit dicenda ‘Forum putealque Libonis
Mandabo siccis, adimam cantare severis:’
Hoc simul edixi, non cessavere poetae
