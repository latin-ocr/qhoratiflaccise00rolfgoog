1. oemtm cf the satire: Horace's criticism of Lucilius (cs. iv.)
had doubtless awalrened a great deal of opposition. ln this satire,
which forms the epilogue to his first collection, he justifies his opinion
of his predecessor, and more fully defines his own position.

2. outline:

l. Horace not only found faults in Lucilius, but good points as
well. lle repeats his previous statement.
a) The versification of Lucilius is careless and rude, although
hiswitislreen, l-6;
h) liis style lacks brevity and variety, 7-14;
c) He is too caustic. Good-natured raillery is often more
effective, 14-19;
d) llis admirere praise his free use of Greek words aud phrases
This is really a defect, 20-35.
2. Horace detines his own ideal. lle would found a new school
ofsatirc:
a) lie leaves epic and dramatic poetry to others. He finds
himself best adapted to satire (cs. in, outline, 2, c, ff),
lt) He does not claim to equsl Lucilius, but this does not pre-
vent him from recognizing‚ and trying fo avoid, the
latter’s faults, 46-64 ς
