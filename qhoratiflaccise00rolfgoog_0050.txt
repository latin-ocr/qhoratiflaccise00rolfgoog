mind in thinking oi Latin. In Latin, word-accent was so
weak that it could not be made the basis of versification as
it is in English, while, on the other hand, quantity was a
strongly marked feature oi the spoken language. Thus we
see how it came about that quantity was made the basis of
Latin verse, and why accent was not.

We are, then, to conceive of a line of Latin poetry as
consisting simply of a regular arrangement of long and
short syllables—nothing else. Το read Latin poetry,
therefore, it is necessary simply to pronounce the words
with the proper quantity. This takes some patience and
practice, but it is easily within the power of every pupil oi
Latin who can read Latin prose with quantitative accuracy.
lt is in Latin asin English: any one who can read prose
with accuracy and fluency has no difficulty in reading
poetry. The poet arranges the words in such wisc that
they make poetry of themselves if they are only properly
pronouuced. No other kind of poetry was ever known in
any language. N o other is easily conceivable.

Of course it necessarily takes time ior the student’s ear
to become sensitive to quantitative differences and to ac·

Yet, with patience and abundant practice in careful pro

nnnoiation, the quantitative sense is bound to develop.

Two views of ictus are held. According to one view,
ictus is a stress accent. This makes Lat-in verse accentual,
precisely like English poetry. According to the other view,
ictus is merely the quantitative prominence inherent in
the long syllable of every fundamental loct-the iambus,
trochee, dactyl, and anapaest¹
