the result would bo no more fatal than to read a line of
Latin poetry with neglect of the quantity.

In reading Latin verse, there are two classes of errors to
which the student is particularly liable, either one of which
results in giving a wrong syllabic quantity.

In ‘open’ ¹ Syllables

Here the quantity of the syllable is always the sameas
the quantity of the vowel. Thus, in mel-ter, the first syllable
is long, in paler, the first syllable is short.

This being so, it is imperative that the pupil should in
‘open’ syllables scrupulously observe the quantity of the
vowel. If he pronounces a short vowel long, or a long
vowel short, he thereby gives a false quantity to the syl·

lable‚ and thus wreclrs the line completely. 'she pupil‚
therefore, nrust know the quantity of every vowel, and
must pronounce in the light of his knowledge.. He must
not say pero, tero, sero (for pero, tero, sero), nor must he
say poter, oper, olel, quod, qulbus, inpensum, es (‘ thou art '),
etc. One such error in a verse is fatal to its rnetrical struc-
ture, and the pupil who habitually commits such errors in
reading is simply wasting valuable time.

But in order to be long it must be actually closed ia pro·
