WORD·ACCEN'1'.

In reading Latin poetry, the ordinary accent of the words
should not be neglected. But, as we have already seen
above (p. xxv), the word-accent in Latin was exceedingly
slight. We almost invariably accent Latin words altogether
too strongly. As a result we destroy the quantity of the
remaining syllables of a word. Thus, in a word like ἑυῐ·
tottam, we are inclined to stress the penultimate syllable
with such energy as to reduce the quantity of the vowel in
each of ¹the three preceding syllables. In this way the
pupil says evitabat-tor. Such a pronunciation is a fatal
defect in reading. What we ought to do is to make the
quantity prominent and the acuent very slight. Where
this is done, the accent will be felt to be subordinate to the
quantity, as it ought to he, endas it must be if oue is ever
to acquire a feeling for the quantitative character of Latin
poetry. If the quantity is not made more prominent than

⁴ the accent, the accent is bound to be more prominent than
the quantity, which will be fatal to the acquisition ol a
quantitative sense for the verse.

Inasmuch as Latin poetry was based on the quantity of
syllables, it is obvious that the greatest care must be taken
in the pronunciation of the words witha view to securing
an absolutely correct syllabic quantity. Otherwise the
metrica] (te. quantitative) character of the verse is violated,
and the effect intended hy the poet is lost. To ignore the
proper quantity of the syllables is as disastrous iu a line of
Latin poetry as it would be in English poetry to misplace
the word-accent. if one were to read the opening line of ,
