It consiste of actual letters and of fictitious ones.¹

The second book of Epistles is devoted wholly to literary
criticisrn. Horace has renounced the writing of lyries, he
tells us, and will hereaiter teaeh the art of poetry instead
of practising it. The chronology of this book offers not a
few difficulties. The second Epistle is evidently the earliest
. and may be placed between 20 and 17 rac.

The recognition oi Horace as the poet laureate of Rome,
by the invitation to write the Carmen Saeculorc, gave him a
very different position before the publio, and is responsible
for the assured tone of the De Arte Poenae, originally the
third letter of the collection, although the second in chrono
logical order. It is assigned with most probability to the
year 16 rac. These two letters, with an introductory epistle
in which the collection is dedicated to Augustus, appear to
have been published in 14 nc,

26. The school of Lucilius is further represented by the
sin satires of A. Persius Flaccus (34-62 nn.) of Volaterrae in
Etruria He was a diligent reader and ardent admirer pf
Horace, whose language he frequently paraphrases in his
own peculiar style. Also hythe sixteen satires of D. Iunius
Iuvenalis (circ. 46-130 nn.) of Aquinum.

2⁷. of other writers of satire, evidently of the school
of Lucilius, Horace expressly mentions’ Ρ. amandus Varro
(82-37 nc.) of Atax in Gallia Narbonensis, called Atacinus
to distinguish him from the author of the Saturae Menippeas.
No fragments of his satires have been preserved, although
we have scanty remeius of an epic‚ the Bellum depressum,
of a Choroprophio, and of an Epiremerie.
