on INTOLERANT JUDGMENT.
1. outline:

l. Men have no patience with the faults oi others, but are lenient

toward their own :

a) They see many inconsistencies in the conductui their
neighbors, l-lii;

b) They plend guilty to a certain degree oi iallibility, but their
silly seli-love makes them par-don themselves, lii-285

c) They will not see the good qualities oi their fellows, even
though these far outweigh their deiecta, 29-37 ;

d) They would do well to cultivate love‘s blindness, and re-
gard their friends' fallings as virtues, 38-543

e) Asamatter of iact,they exaggerate these iailingsinto serious
iaults, teos,

s) As they judge, so will they be judged‚ 66-75.

2. Intolerant judgment is fostered by the doctrine oi the Stoica,

that all taulis are equal. This doctrine is false z

c) lt is the height oi iolly to make no distinction between
trivial offences arrd crimes, 76-95;

b) To regard all inulte as equal is contrary to common sense
and to the interests oi society, 96-98;

c) 1t is founded on a ialse conception oi the nature oi law:

1) As nien emerged irom astate oi barbarism, he made
laws ior his own protection, 99-112;

2) They were not based on a simple division of all ecte
intoright andwrong, but onagradation oi offences
according to their effect on the welfare oi the com· ¹ -
munim, 113-124;

¹ d) We might infer its falsity from that oi another absurd doc-

trine oi the Stoics, that the philosopher, as such, isskilled

iu every kind oi work end is a lring among men, inl-136.

3. Horace prefers to be a private citizen, and to live on terms oi
mutual tolerance with his lellowmen‚ 136-142.

2. Time: The exact date is uncertain, not aiter 35 nc.
