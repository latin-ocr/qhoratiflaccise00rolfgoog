Iuli Flore, quibus terrarum militaturis
Claudius Augusti privignus, seire laboro.
Thracane vos Hebrusque nivali compede vinctus,
An fieta vicinae inter currentia turris,
An pingues Asiae campi collesque morantur? ι
Quid studiosa cohors operum struit? Hoc quoque curo.
Quis sibi res gestas Augusti scribere sumit?
Bella quis et paces longum diffundit in aevum?
Quid Titius Romana brevi venturus in ora?
Pindarici fontis quinon expalluit haustus,
Fastidire lacus et rivos ausus apertos.
Ut valet? Ut meminit nostri? Fidibusne Latinis
Thebanos aptare modos studet auspice Musa,
An tragica desaevit et ampullatur in arte?
Quid mihi Celsus agit? Monitus multumque monendus, ιι .
Privatae ut quaerat opes ei tangere vitet ’
