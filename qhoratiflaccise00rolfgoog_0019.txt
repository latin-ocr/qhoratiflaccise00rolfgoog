the scope aud functiou of satire as a species of literary
composition.

a 'rho mdes-These were published iu 29 mc. and
mark the transition from the Satires to the Odes. They
resemble the Satires iu their frequent polemio character, the
Odes in the lyric form in which they are cast 'shough
published aiter the two books of the Satires, several oi
them apparently represent the earliest oi Horace’s efforts
in verse that have been preserved.

ι 9. ‘l'he Odes aud Carmen Saeculare. - Books Ῑ.-ῙΙΙ. of the
Odcs were published in 23 nc, when Horace was iortytwo
years old. Many oi them had unquestionably been written

several years before, some apparently as early as 32 nc.
These Odes at once raised Horace to the iront rank of Roman
poets, and assured his permanent fame. Six years later
(17 aa), hc was the natural choice oi Augustus for the com-
position οἱ the Carmen »saeculare to be sung attho saecular
celebration held in that year. Iu 13 ac, appeared Book IV.
of the Odcs. Though containing some oi the poet's best
work, this last book nevertheless bears certain traces oi
perfunctoriness. 'she Suetouian life of Horace records that
it was written at the express request of the Emperor-a
statement borne out by tm lack of spontaneity characteristic
of some of the poems.

10. 'rhe Epistles and Ars poetica. -There are two books
of Epistles. Book I. was published in ‘20 ac, Book 11.
probably in 14 ac. Of the epistlcs contained iu Book 1,
some are genuine letters such as friend might write to
iriend; others are simply disquisitions in verse form ou
questions of life, letters, or philosophy. Book II. consists oi ,
but two epistlcs, one to Julius Florus, the other to Augustus.
Both these pieocs deal with questions of literary criticism
and poetic composition.
