HAPPINESS DEPENDS UPON virtutis.

1. occasion oi the Epistle: Horace iears that his friend Quinctius
Hirpinus, to whom he addresscd Odes, ii. ll, cares too much ior office
and ior political favor. He reminds him in what true virtue consuis,
and that it alone can conier lasting happiness.

ἢ 2. outline:

1. HoracedescribesthesimpleattractionsoihisSabineFarm,l-16;
2. Hirpinusis generally regarded as a happy man; he can be truly
ao, only by having right ideals oi life, 17-202
a) He must not rate too highly the verdict oi the massas, and
think himself a good man because they call him so, 21-32;
b) A wise man will not ralue their houors, which they cau take
away as well as give, or iear their criticism, 33-403
c) Appearances aredeceitiul. A man maybeoutwardly good,
because he iears the law, while his beart isfilled with evil
desires; such a one is really no better than salavelt-723
d) 'l'he trnly virtuous man will iear nothing; no threats, even
oi death, can make him guilty oi an unworthy act, ts-is.

Ne perconteris, fundus meus, optime Quincti,
Arvo pascat erum au bacis opulentet olivae
Pomisue et pratis an amicta vitibus ulmo,
Scribetur tibi forma loquaciter et situs agri.
Continui montes, ni dissocientur opaca
Valle, sed ut veniens dextrum latus adspiciat sol,
Laevum discedens curru fugiente vaporet.
Temperiem laudes, Quid si rubicunda benigni
Corna vepres et pruna ferant, si quercus et ilex
Multa fruge pecus, multa dominum iuvet umbra? , 1⁰
Dicas adductum propius frondere Tarentum.
Fons etiam rivo dare nornen idoneus, ut uec
Frigidior Thracam nec purior ambiat Hebrus,
Infirmo capiti fluit utilis, utilis alvo.
