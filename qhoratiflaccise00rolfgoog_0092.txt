SERMONUM

IX.

A PUSHING FELLOW.

1. Oufliue: Horace describes his sufferings at the hands oi a de-
termined fellow, who forced himself upon him in the hope of being
presented to Maecenas. The poet freely rereals his laclr of the moral
courage necessary for snubbing his tormentor. The man very likely
had no real existence, but merely represents a type; at any rate, all
attempta to identify hirn have failed.

l. The bore succeeds in attaching himself ιο Horace:

a) Horace is accosted‚ and makes the fatal mistalre of replying
politely, 1-83

b) He tries to rid himself of the fellow‚ but though the latter
sees that his companyis unwelcome, he refuses to be
shaken off, 8-19;

o) Theman tries ιο recommend himself by enumerating his
doubtful accomplishments‚ 20-253

ἀ) Horace interrupte him hut cannot speals his mind, 26-34 ;

e) Au engagement which the man has in court promises relief,
but hc prefers ιο let iege, 3543.

2. After wearing out Horace‘s rather feeble resistance, the man
reveals his purpose : ,

α) He assumes that Herace‘s intimacy with Maecenas is
prompted by seli-interest, and offers ιο help him push
his fortunes, 43-48 ;

b) Horace assures him that he is mistaken. His sense of
humor leads him to encourage the fellow, 48-60.

3. A meeting with Aristius Fuscus gives Horace a ray of hope,
but the former, who knows his friend's fatal wealrness,
amuses himself at his expense :

a) He pretends not to see the situation, 60e63

h) He admits an appointment which Horace claims ιο hare
with him, but puts it oli toa more favorable time, tte-745

o) The plalntiff in the lawsuit plays the part of a deus ea
machina, 74-78.

2. Time : The exact date is uncertain3 not after 35 nc.

Ibam forte Via Sacra, sieut meus est mos
Nescio quid meditans nugarum; totus in illis.
