⁵4. Beside the literary language in the elassioal period,
we find also the somno familiaris or sonno cotidianae, the
language used by edueated Romans in the ordinary eonver-
sation 01 everyday lile, and thesemo plebeius or sermo nns-
tione, the lauguage 01 the common people.¹ Of the former
we have representatives in the elassioal literature in the
Lettere 01 Cicero, and in the Sermones, aud, to a less marked
degree, in the Epistlee 01 Horaee. In. early Latin, the plays
01 Terence belong to the same olass', while in those 011100-
tus we have a eombiuation 01 the sermo cotidianae and
the sermo plebeius. It le not always easy to distinguish
between the sermo cotidianus and the senno plebeios, or to
distinguish what is colloquial from what is merely arellam,
