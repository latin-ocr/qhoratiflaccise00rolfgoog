Ulixes. Hoc quoque, Tiresia, praeter narrata petenti
Responde, quibus amissas reparare queam res
Artibus atque modis. Quid rides? Tiresias. Iamne doloso
Non satis est Ithacam revehi patriosque penatis
Aspiccrc? U. Onulli quicquam mentite, vides ut 5
Nudus inopsque domum redeam te vate, neque illic
Aut apotheca procis intacta est aut pecus: atqui
Et genus et virtus, nisi cum re, vilior alga est.

T. Quando pauperiem missis ambagibus horres,
Accipe qua ratione queas ditescere. Turdus 10·
Sive aliud privum dabitur tibi, devolet illuc,
Res ubi magna nitet domino sene; dulcia poma
