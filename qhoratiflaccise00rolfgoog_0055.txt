prevalent in the Middle states. As a result, the pupilis
apt to pronounce Latin with the same neglect of the r that he
habitually practises in the vernacular. This omission occurs
particularly where the preceding vowel is unaccented, eg. in
portorum, teminorum, etc. The pupil is likely to say

publicium, le(r)·minorum‚ ie. he makes the preceding syl·

long. In order to close the syllable, a distinct articulation
of the r is necessary. When this is overlooked, the quantity
of the syllable is lost and the metrioal character of the line
is destroyed. .

of doing the same thing in Latin. Experience teaches that
pupils often say urbi mortuis for urbis porlds; copi sconem
for copis canera, even urbi sulci for urbis vici, etc. Care
must be taken to join the final s clearly with the preceding
vowel. Otherwise the preceding syllable will be left ‘open'
and short where it ought to be ‘closed' and long.

The foregoing cautious are not mere theoretical inventione.

which we as English-speaking people naturally commit when

read Latin poetry quantitatively3 and unless we do so read
it, we necessarily fail to reproduce its true character.
