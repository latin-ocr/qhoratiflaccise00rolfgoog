A CLEVER PUN.

1. occasion oi the satire: The moin point oi this brief but finished
satire is the pun oi Persius, which hod evidently become the talk oi
tho town. The incident occurred during Roroce’s service es tribune
in the army oi Brutus. In 43 nc. the letter went irom Macedonis
into Asin, to raise troops and money, and to confer with Cassius. At
Clazomenae one oi his followers, P. Turpilius Rex, mecine involved in
n lnwsuit, which was tried beiore Brutus.

2. outline:

1. The characteristics oi the litigante, l-8;

2. Their bitter animosity,·9-21 ;

3. The speech oi Persius. He lauds Brutus ond his staff, with
the exception of Rex, whom he roundly abuses, 22-27;

4. Rex overwhelms him with e torrent oi invective, 2831.

5. But Persius turns the tebles hy his wit, 32-35.

3. Time: Opinione differwidelyss Some essert that the story could
heve no point unless it were told soon after the event, ond regard this
as Horoce’s earliest satire. Others think that his attitude towards

Brutus, and the finished style, point to a much later dete. The latter
view seems the more probable.

Ἴ Proscripti Regis Rupili pus atque venenum
Hybrida quo pacto sii Persius ultus, opinor
Omnibus et lippis notum et tonsoribus esse.

Persius hic permagna negotia dives habebat
Clazomenis, etiam litis curn Rege molestas,

Durus homo atque odio qui posset vincere Regem,
Confidens tumidusque, adeo sermonis amari,
Sisennae, Barros ut equis praecurreret albis.

Ad Regem redeo. Postquam nihil inter utrumque
Convenit (hoc etenim sunt omnes iure molesti, 10
Quo fortes, quibus adversum bellum incidit: inter
Hectora Priamiden animosum atque iuter Achillem
Ira fuit capitalis, ui ultima divideret mors,
