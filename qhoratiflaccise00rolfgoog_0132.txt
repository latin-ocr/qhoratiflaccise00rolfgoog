Quae procul exstructis inerant hesterna canistris. '105
Ergo ubi purpurea porrectum in veste locavit

Agrestem, veluti succinctus cursitat hospes

continuatque dapes, necnon verniliter ipsis

Fungitur officiis, praelambens omne quod adfert.

Ille cubans gaudet mutata sorte bonisque 110
Rebus agit laetum convivam, cum subito ingens

Valvarum strepitus lectis excussit utrumque.

Currere per toturn pavidi conclave, magisque

Exanimes trepidare, simul domus alta Molossis

Personuit canibus. Turn rusticus ‘Haud milri vita 115
Est opus hac,’ ait, ‘et valeas, me silva carusque

Tutus ab insidiis tenui solabitur ervo!
