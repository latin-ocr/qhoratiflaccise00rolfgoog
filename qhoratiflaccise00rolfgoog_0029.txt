Quintilian, and Tacitus.

23. Horace seems tu have written at first along the lines
followedby Lucilius, to judge from Serus. i. 2. This style
of writing did not, however, accord with his personal dis-
position, and in Serm. i. 4 and 10¹ he criticises the work of
his predecessor and defines his own ideal. At the same
time, he regarded Lucilius as having established the out-
ward formos this species oi composition, and he follows
him in using the dactylis hexameter, ignoring Varro's re·
turn to the old-iashioned mediey. While deprecating
Lucilius’s severity in invective, he follows the general lines
oi his predecessor, giving us experiences from his own life,¹
treating ethical problema,³ and defining his literary aims
and ideals.⁴

Horatius ipse condteatur, cam ait: Sunt quibas in sutura videar niueis
acer, et ultra Lepem tendere apris (Serra. ii. l. 1-2)‚ tamen proprios
titulos voluit ei accommodare. Nam hos priores duos libros ‘Ser-
mouumss posteriores ‘Epistularum' inscribens, in samonam uomina
salt iutellepi quasi apud praesentem se loqui, epistulas uero quasi ad

. absentes missas. In this book the terms Satires and Satira are used of

the Semnonesand Epistulae together or oi the literary satire in general.
The two divisions are referred to separately either by their Latin names,
or as Semnones and Epistles.
